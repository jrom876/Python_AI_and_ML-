# Python_AI_and_ML-
This contains the code to read and predict CO2 sensor data using Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning, and Neural Networks.

It uses pandas, matplotlib, numpy, scipy, sklearn, and various other Python libraries.

It takes raw data from the serial port of a DHT11 Temp/Humid and K30 CO2 sensor node pinging data at 2.4GHz and running on an Arduino Uno.

I may include this Arduino code in the future.

This is part of my AI, ML, and Neural Network projects.
