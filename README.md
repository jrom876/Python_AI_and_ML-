# Python_AI_and_ML-
The co2_data directory contains AI/ML/NN development code for a recent project.

The main file -- co2_data/read_serial.py -- contains Python code to read CO2 sensor data, make predictions, and display data plots using various AI/ML/NN algorithms and Python data science libraries.

It requires pandas, matplotlib, numpy, scipy, sklearn, and various other Python libraries.

This code extracts and processes raw CO2 data from the serial port of an Arduino K30 CO2 sensor node pinging data on an nRF24L01 at 2.4GHz.

I am still working on the nRF24L01 handler for my RPi 5 B+ platform, so I am using the Arduino serial port data for now.

I may include the Arduino K30 code and hardware requirements in the future.

This is part of my AI, ML, and Neural Network projects.
