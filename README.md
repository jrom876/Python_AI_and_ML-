# Python_AI_and_ML-
The co2_data directory contains Python AI/ML/NN code that extracts and processes raw CO2 data from the serial port of an Arduino K30 CO2 sensor node pinging data on an nRF24L01 at 2.4GHz.

The main CO2 file -- co2_data/read_serial.py -- contains code to read CO2 sensor data, make predictions, and display data plots using various AI/ML/NN algorithms and Python data science libraries.

TODO:  Finish the nRF24L01 handler for an RPi 5 B+ platform; I am using the Arduino serial port data for now.

TODO:  Include the Arduino K30 code and hardware requirements.

This is part of my AI, ML, and Neural Network projects.
