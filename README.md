# Python_AI_and_ML-
This co2_data directory contains some of my AI/ML/NN development code.

The main file -- read_serial.py -- contains the Python code to read CO2 sensor data, make predictions, and display data plots using AI/ML/NN algorithms and Python data science libraries.

It requires pandas, matplotlib, numpy, scipy, sklearn, and various other Python libraries.

It extracts raw data from the serial port of a K30 CO2 sensor node pinging data at 2.4GHz and running on an Arduino Uno.

I may include this Arduino code in the future.

This is part of my AI, ML, and Neural Network projects.
